## Usage

### Adding Tailwind CSS Classes

You can start using Tailwind CSS classes in your HTML files. For example:

```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  Hello, Tailwind CSS!
</div>
```

### Customizing Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS can be customized to fit your project's design requirements. You can configure your Tailwind setup by editing the `tailwind.config.js` file.

#### Example Configuration

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  purge: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}", "./public/index.html"],
  darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

## Customization

### Extending the Theme

You can extend the default theme by adding new values to the `extend` section in your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: "#1D4ED8",
        secondary: "#9333EA",
      },
      spacing: {
        128: "32rem",
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### Using Plugins

Tailwind CSS has a robust plugin system that allows you to add custom utilities, components, and more. You can add plugins to your project by installing them via npm and adding them to the `plugins` array in your `tailwind.config.js` file.

#### Example Plugin Usage

```javascript
// Install the plugin
npm install @tailwindcss/forms

// Add the plugin to your Tailwind configuration
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/forms'),
  ],
}
```
